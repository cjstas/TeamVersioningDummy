Over summer, I (Christo Staszewski) Had an Internship for Crowe. During this, I worked on some problems and created solutions for the given projects they had me work on. 
After my internship was over, I went on vacation to the Badlands with some of my friends. 
There, while climbing a sheer face, I lost grip and smacked my face into the cliffside, resulting in a cut across the bottom of my chin. 
For the rest of the summer, I went back to work for the local furniture store “A Furniture and Bedding Showcase” here in Muncie.

This summer, I (Daniel Spencer) took an online class called Mobile Development and also detailed some cars on the side to make some money. My friend and I
started a small business washing and detailing cars last summer and have maintained it throughout the year as a small source of income. It's
nice being able to work on your own schedule and with your own clients. The online class was also enjoyable and I learned a lot about programming
using Android Studio. I made some small applications that would run on an Android phone like JSON parser and a Weather Alerts app.
